#The Plot

To exercise my python skills and because I needed a fun project to learn how to
create an AI, I decide to develop a tic-tac-toe game.

# The journey 
The project was a quick way for me to catch-up on concepts of classic AI

# Classic AI
On the subject of "Classic AI" as I will call it, I wanted to develop an AI
self-learning algorithm that would develop its own manner of playing
tic-tac-toe efficiently. 

I am aware that there are better ways of programming an unbeatable tic-tac-toe
bot (i.e. creating an n-dimensional matrix with all the games and potential
outcomes, that would be used by the bot in making a decision), but my curiosity
was to see if I can achieve results through this alternative method.

After managing to implement the algorithm in the classical manner, I wanted to
look into using Tensorflow and a more modern approach to solving the issue. 

#PYGame
The games started as a simple terminal application and after reading about pygame developed into a pygame application.
