# What is it?
Linear regression reduces 2D data into a simple linear function - can be drawn as a line. It is a corelation test, thus we need two numerical informations.

# Why would we want this?
Linear regression is a data analysis tool that allows us to draw conclusions between the x and the y of any two dimensional dataset. In essence the line is a function which is on average closest to all of the points defined by the dataset. By doing so, the function can reduce the noise of the information and give us a clearer picture of what the data is telling us.

# How to calculate it?

| X   | Y  | X |
|-----|----|---|
|  20 | 4  |   |
| 25  | 5  |   |
| 30  | 6  |   |
| 1   | 20 |   |
| x   | y  |   |

### The square method 
- firstly we need to calculate the mean X and Y value of the dataset
