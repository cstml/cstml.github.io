  intro: |
    :wave: Hi. I am a senior software engineer with experience spanning from
    fin-tech, compliance, and banking, to cryptocurrencies and building
    construction software. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

    Creative problem-solving drives me, and I believe in thoroughly analysing
    the problem domain and its constraints to provide an elegant and customised
    solution. My passions include functional programming, programming language
    theory, reinforcement learning, and distributed systems architecture. I am
    continually exploring the interplay between mathematics, data, and our
    comprehension of the world and am always on the hunt for the "perfect" tool
    or solution to bring my ideas to fruition. In my previous collaborations, I
    have worked alongside cross-functional teams, including technology and
    business teams, and understand the significance of teamwork and
    communication in delivering successful projects.

        Part of a Haskell and Rust Software consultancy, I had the opportunity
        to work for a multitude of clients and projects, including developer
        tooling, compilers, blockchain decentralised apps, technical audits, and
        protocol designs. The work involved scope discovery and the delivery of
        the solution end to end, in many situations within constricted
        timelines, budgets and resourcing - all done on top of rapidly changing
        codebases. Given the mentioned context, I had to deliver quantifiable
        value for our clients - having the opportunity of leading a couple of
        projects as the Tech Lead of small (3 to 4 person) teams.
