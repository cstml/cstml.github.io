Hello, my name is Vlad and I like programming and maths. I also like
Architecture.

The enjoyment I get from coding has been with me since childhood, when at a
young age, I started going to our local extra-curricular Children's Club.
Here, you could  choose the courses you wanted to study, and being absolutely
fascinated with computers I chose to attend the "Informatics" and "Electronics"
clubs. On a daily basis, I would go and learn Turbo Pascal and play with
electronics, soldering all sorts of small circuits and contraptions. Some days,
if we managed to solve all of our problems swiftly, we would get to play
Warcraft and/or DOOM. Needless to say, this was a magical time that has
stayed with me.  Even today, every time I manage to make a piece of code
work, there still is a spark of that excitement present. Furthermore, being
passionate about mathematics, in general, I find the problem solving
aspects of programming one of the very satisfying bits about it - nothing
beats solving an unsolvable problem.

I usually tweet at @cstml

Hope you enjoy your stay here.
