Hello, my name is Vlad and I like programming and maths. I also like
Architecture.

I come from a computer-science with mathematics background, competing at a
county and national level throughout my college years. During this time I
learnt a lot of fundamental algorithms, C/C++, data structures, and
mathematics . My greatest performance was in my last year of
college(2012) when I managed to secure second place at our county's Computer
Science Olympics- qualifying to the national phase. I wanted to pursue a career
in Computer Science but decided in the last second to have a go at
Architecture, with the reasoning that I can always return to CS. Now I am
planning of fully returning. 

In my professional career as an Architect and Architectural Assistant I have
been involved in both visual coding (with Dynamo and grasshopper) and writing
Python and some C#. During these years (since finishing college and during
university), I have also maintained a passion for learning and programming in
my spare time.  I am motivated to finally commit to my real passion of CS &
Mathematics, and by doing so, to have more time to practice and get better at
it.

The enjoyment I get from coding has been with me since childhood, when at a
young age, I started going to our local extra-curricular Children's Club.
Here, you could  choose the courses you wanted to study, and being absolutely
fascinated with computers I chose to attend the "Informatics" and "Electronics"
clubs. On a daily basis, I would go and learn Turbo Pascal and play with
electronics, soldering all sorts of small circuits and contraptions. Some days,
if we managed to solve all of our problems swiftly, we would get to play
Warcraft and/or DOOM. Needless to say, this was a magical time that has
stayed with me.  Even today, every time I manage to make a piece of code
work, there still is a spark of that excitement present. Furthermore, being
passionate about mathematics, in general, I find the problem solving
aspects of programming one of the very satisfying bits about it - nothing
beats solving an unsolvable problem.

Hope you enjoy your stay here.
