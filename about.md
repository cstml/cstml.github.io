Hello, and welcome to my perpetually out of sync blog.

I use this space to put out small snippets of information, without 
editing it too much. Sometimes I am wrong and I come back and edit
or remove it - so it is a bit in constant flow. Other times I am wrong
and am not aware of it (yet). What is sure to say, is that it's all 
*work in progress* - and fun times.

I usually tweet at @cstml.

If you really enjoy my writing and find it useful - you can always
honour me with a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/cstml).

Hope you enjoy your visit, and if you see any mistakes please let me 
know with a pull request [on gitHub](https://github.com/cstml/cstml.github.io).
