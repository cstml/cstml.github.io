# Errors
### 1. Syntax error
- these are the type of errors where you wrongly type in a `;` or miss one

### 2. Runtime error
- a runtime error is characterised by a bit of code that could cause problems 
at runtime.
- for example a memory leak could be a runtime error
- or maybe a `div 0`

### 3. Logical error
- program runs
- it is not doing what you intend it to do.
