# Mutex

library: `<mutex>`

constructor: `std::mutex`

## What is a Mutex
A `mutex` is a class synchronisation primitive. We use `mutex`s when we want to
synchronise parallel running threads. As always lets look at an example

---
## Case Study:
### Example 1: Normal class
I have made this `Timer` class that counts down each second from a given timer:
```c++
class Timer{
public:
  Timer(const int &timer){
    std::cout<<"Counting to: "<<timer<<std::endl;
    for (int i=0; i < timer; i++) {
      std::cout<<i<<std::endl;
      sleep(1);
    }
    std::cout<<"Time is up"<<std::endl;
  }
};
```
So if we were to instantiate this timer in the main class :
```c++
int main() {
  Timer time(3);
  Timer newTime(3);
  std::cout<<"Do something else in the meantime"<<std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
the output would be:
```
Counting to: 3
0
1
2
Time is up
Counting to: 3
0
1
2
Time is up
```
#### Analysis:
- the program blocks after each call to construct a timer
- the program executes linearly
- the program must wait for both timers to reach the end before it can `do
  something else`

### Example 2: Multi-Threading class
OK so what if we want the program to be able to do stuff while the counter is
running. As we have seen in the previous case, the program has to wait for both
timers to finish prior to executing other commands. Let's have a first stab at
redesigning the class:
```c++
class Timer{
private: 
  std::thread *thread;

public:
  Timer(const int &timer){
    this->thread = new std::thread(
        [&timer](){
          std::cout<<"Counting to: "<<timer<<std::endl;
          for (int i=0; i < timer; i++) {
            std::cout<<i<<std::endl;
            sleep(1);
          }
          std::cout<<"Time is up"<<std::endl;
    });
  }

  ~Timer(){
    this->thread->join();
    delete this->thread;
  }
};
```
So what have we done here:
- we have introduced a pointer to a thread for each instance of the timer
- we have changed the simple function to a lambda function to allow us to
  easily implement it in the thread creation - this is nice and compact,
  otherwise we would have had to implement the function separately
- we have created a new thread for each instance of the timer 
- before we destruct the instance of timer, we have to wait for its associated
  thread to finish  and then we have to deallocate the thread.

So how will this change our output from main:
```
Do something else in the meantime
Counting to: Counting to: 93
0

0
1
1
2
2
Time is up
3
4
5
6
7
8
Time is up
```
Analysis:
- That's interesting, so now we see that the program did not block upon the
creation of the timers, but rather carried on through and executed the `Do
something else` logging, while in parallel the two threads started counting.
- Another interesting thing is that the counters are not interested with what
  is being plotted at that specific time, we can see the output stream being
  overridden as it comes out and the output (especially at the beginning when
  we have 3 threads going in parallel) being all mangled up.

### Example 3: Multi-Threading class and mutex
Say we want to still be able not to block in our execution, but we do want some
order in the way the timers run, for example, we don't want both timers to run
at the same time, but rather in sequence one after another.

This is where a `mutex` comes into play

```c++
class Timer{
private: 
  std::thread *thread;

public:
  Timer(const int &timer, std::mutex *mutex){
    this->thread = new std::thread(
        [&timer, mutex](){
          mutex->lock();
          std::cout<<"Counting to: "<<timer<<std::endl;
          for (int i=0; i < timer; i++) {
            std::cout<<i<<std::endl;
            sleep(1);
          }
          std::cout<<"Time is up"<<std::endl;
          mutex->unlock();
    });
  }

  ~Timer(){
    this->thread->join();
    delete this->thread;
  }
};
```
And now we have to make a few changes to the main as well, as we need to
implement a `mutex` that we would send to the class.

```c++
int main() {
  std::mutex mutex;
  Timer time(3, &mutex);
  Timer newTime(9, &mutex);
  std::cout<<"Do something else in the meantime"<<std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
And the output:
```
Do something else in the meantime
Counting to: 9
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
Time is up
Counting to: 3
0
1
2
Time is up
```
#### Analysis:
- we have our non blocking timer
- we are also still keeping track of the order in which timers are created, and
  each timer starts after the end of the next
