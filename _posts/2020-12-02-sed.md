title: "sed: one stream editor to rule them all"

# Sed 

As a VIM user sed really appeals to me for a few reasons:
- I enjoy UNIX, a lot. And A few weeks ago I was reading a book about unix when
  i stumbled upon one of the oldest editors in unix and that is `ed`. The more
  I looked into it the more I realised where a lot of vim featurs come from.

- well, sed is just the stream version of ed

Nice!

# Small list of stuff that sed does:

- sed will replace in the stream the same way vim does by using `s\`

## Examples:
I was looking at converting some simple latex files into markdown. I know
pandoc would have done the job but these were pretty simple, and some of them
had some errors in them that i did not want to fix. So I sed this :

```bash
sed "s\[\]end{document}\ \g" rprt2-methodology.tex | \
sed '1,29d'  |\
sed "s\[\]end{enumerate}\ \g"  |\
sed "s\[\]section{\# \g"  |\
sed "s\[\]subsection{\## \g"  |\
sed "s\}\ \g"  
```

```bash
sed "s\[\]section\# \g" rprt1-bugs-and-omissions.tex \
  |sed "s\[\]item \- \g" \
  |sed "s\[\]begin{compactitem}\ \g" \
  |sed "s\[\]end{compactitem}\ \g" \
  |sed "/end/ d" \
  |sed "/^[ ]*$/ d" \
  |sed "/^$/ d" \
  |sed "1,13 d" \
  |sed "8,12 d" \
  |sed "s\[\]verb\ \g" \
  |head -n 50
```



Ok, it might seem like a lot, but how did I develop this? By simply running
each until I had the result I wanted. To repeat and improve i used `fc` , this
way I would run them one by one, and then improve until I got the result I
wanted.

|   Command         |           Description                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
|"\s\foo\bar\g"      |just like in vim substitutes globally  |
|"1,50d"            | delete from line 1 to line 50 |
