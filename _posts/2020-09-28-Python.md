# Notes to selfâ€‹ :musical_note:

### CONSTANTS

In **Python** variables cannot be declared as constants. Thus the common standard is to write them in full caps

```python
THIS_IS_A_PYTHON_CONSTANT = "I am not shouting"
thisApparentlyIsNot = "I can assure you"
```

### Division

Whenever we write 

```python
a = 3/2
print(a)
```

Python will output `1.5`

But to force integer division we need to use `\\`.

```python
a = 3//2
print(a)
```

Will output `1`

Of course, you can always cast it with `int(a)`.
