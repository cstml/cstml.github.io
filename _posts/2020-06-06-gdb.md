# GDB

I have been coding quite a bit lately for #leetcode30daychallenge and I choose mostly to do it in C++. 

I truly enjoy C++ and am enjoying both refreshing and learning new concepts about it. Let's jump in

### GDB 

| Name                      | Command  | What it does                                                 |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TUI (Text User Interface) | ctrl+x+a | it opens the Text User Interface of the GDB. I was so happy when I discovered this. Hidden gem. |
