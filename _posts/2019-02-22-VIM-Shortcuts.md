Awesome Articles that I have found across the web:

Spell checking wouldn't be very useful if you didn't have any help correcting
the misspelled words, or a way to tell the program that the word is actually
correct. Let's start with correcting words.  To move to a misspelled word, use
]s and [s. The ]s command will move the cursor to the next misspelled word, the
[s command will move the cursor back through the buffer to previous misspelled
words.  Once the cursor is on the word, use z=, and Vim will suggest a list of
alternatives that it thinks may be correct. For instance, if I highlight
autocompletion and then use z=, I see something like ]  
# VIM Commands 

I am constantly trying to improve my VIM knowledge. Being an old Linux user I
love VIM and have always seen it as real art. Aaaanyway, let's jump right into
it:

# VIM favourites

## Indentation
to Indent stuff just use ">>" or "<<"

To reformat text "gq" is a super useful and fast command.

## Browser
One cool thing about VIM is that it comes with a browser plugin called
**netrw**

For a more detailed article on this go to this
[link](https://shapeshed.com/vim-netrw/)

To open this explorer all you have to do is 
```
:Explore
or
:E
```
- with `i` you can change the view type

- with `I` you can hide the header

This is good for browsing your file structure but you can always use the bash from within VIM by doing `:!ls` or even `:!tree`.

- `:e *` opens the most recent version of a file
- `:e` opens the most recent version of the file itself

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Update*24.02.19*)
Nowadays, I usually use this plugin called [NERDtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), which gives you a nice file browser on the side of your window.

## ctags
One of the most powerful things when it comes to finding definitions in your file structure.

ctags basically allows you to find where a function is defined within your file structure. In order to make it work you have to install it.

On mac this is a very simple case of `brew install ctags`

Afterwards, one has to intialise the ctags within the project folder. This is done by running:
```
ctags -R
```

This recursively will search through your file tree and map your *ctags*

In order to use them within VIM, you have to put the cursor on the definition of whatever you need and then press `<C-]>`(**Control closed bracket**)

To jump back to the root file all you have to do is press `<C-o>` (**Control o**)

# Recording
I absolutely love macros and recording commands. The ease of creating such things in VIM is absolutely **Awesome**. To record any macro you simply:

Press `q` followed by any letter you want to map it to. For example `w`. After this you just type or do the command you would like Macro-ed. `A ; esc j` followed by pressing `q` again. And that's it, your Macro has been created.

To use it, all you have to do is call it with `@` in our case `@w`

Do you want it to be called twice? No worries just use `2@w`.

# Normal
Another really handy thing is `:norm` or `:normal` which basically takes whatever you type after it and normally executes it. For example you want to add 8x`-`. 
Well then all you have to do is 

`:norm 8i-` and **BAM** `--------`
## Terminal

## Searching

### Searching and replacing across the buffer
```
:bufdo %s/pattern/replace/ge | update
```
### Pattern notation:
```
\<old_text\> 
```
--------------------------------------------
### Where to find the VIMRC on a Microsoft PC

```
:version
:echo expand('~')
:echo $HOME
:echo $VIM
:echo $VIMRUNTIME
```

--------------------------------------------
# Tabs
A cool thing to do with tabs is save the current session you are in. 
- Have all of the tabs in your session open
- Type the next command:
```
:mksession header-files-work.vim
```
- Close Vim

To open the session either:
- start the session with vim -S header-files-work.vim
- in vim type `:source header-files-work.vim` 

To update a session:
- simply type : `:mks!`

--------------------------------------------
# Autocomplete without a plugin 
`ctrl+n` in edit mode


--------------------------------------------
# Marks 
Marks are pretty cool ways of navigating files
- to create a mark at a specific line in the local file : press `m` followed by a lower case letter `a`
- to see marks in the document `:marks`
- to create marks across documents : press `m` followed by a capital letter`
- to go to a mark : press ``` followed by the letter you want to go to 

--------------------------------------------
# Indentation 
To correct a files indentation
```
=i{
```
--------------------------------------------
# Clipboards
At any point you can use several clipboards inside VIM
- They are called `registers` and you can see them by typing `:reg`
- To choose which register to use: `"a` for register a
- To yank a line into a register ` "ayy" `
- To paste from a register `"aP"`
--------------------------------------------
# Folds

| Command    | Action                                                   |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| zf#j       | creates a fold from the cursor down # lines.             |
| zf/string  | creates a fold from the cursor to string.                |
| zj         | moves the cursor to the next fold.                       |
| zk         | moves the cursor to the previous fold.                   |
| zo         | opens a fold at the cursor.                              |
| zO         | opens all folds at the cursor.                           |
| zm         | increases the foldlevel by one.                          |
| zM         | closes all open folds.                                   |
| zr         | decreases the foldlevel by one.                          |
| zR         | decreases the foldlevel to zero â€” all folds will be open |
| zd         | deletes the fold at the cursor                           |
| zE         | deletes all folds.                                       |
| zf         | Create fold on the selection                             |
| [z         | move to start of open fold                               |
| ]z         | move to end of open fold                                 |
