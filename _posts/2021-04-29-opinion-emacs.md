title: "opinion: Emacs is ... better?"

*Sorry, the debate for myself is over.*

# Emacs made me a bit of a better programmer.

IKR, I've been such an advocate of VIM for a long time, and still use it a lot. But for some things 
Emacs is just ... better. Funny enough I find that I dislike emacs with evil mode as it just messes
up all the nicety of working with emacs (If I wanted vim I would use VIM is my philosophy). 

After using it for most of my programming work, emacs has changed the way I code, and the way I think
about my programming ways - for the better. 

- If you are programming - emacs is better - you can interact with a running compiler, a running REPL, compile
  see the output, run again. It just works so seemlessly. And all the modes allow you to interact 
  with the program in a much easier and stable way. 
- If you are editing 1 line in the terminal on the fly ... probably VIM is better as it just is easy.

*And that's it*

I have a deadline approaching so will keep it short. Bye!
