title: "opinion: Emacs is ... better?"

*Sorry, the debate for myself is over.*

# Emacs made me a bit of a better programmer.

IKR, I've been such an advocate of VIM for a long time, and still use it a lot. But for some things 
Emacs is just ... better. Funny enough I find that I dislike emacs with evil mode as it just messes
up all the nicety of working with emacs (If I wanted vim I would use VIM is my philosophy). 

# IDE vs text editor

I guess Emacs is ... an IDE - or at least much more so than VIM. I have tried VSCode this year, and 
it is nice, but it felt detached from how I like to work. It is nice and easy and it has a lot of 
plugins, but somehow it doesn't feel right for me. Emacs on the other hand, has great plugins, great 
modes, and just works (well, debatably right? ... kind of just works, like VIM does ... with a lot of 
tinkering ... and that's probably why I like it).  

After using it for most of my programming work, emacs has changed the way I code, and the way I think
about my programming ways - for the better. 

- If you are programming - emacs is better - you can interact with a running compiler, a running REPL, compile
  see the output, run again. It just works so seemlessly. And all the modes allow you to interact 
  with the program in a much easier and stable way. 
- If you are editing 1 line in the terminal on the fly ... probably VIM is better as it just is easy.

*And that's it*

I have a deadline approaching so will keep it short. Bye!
