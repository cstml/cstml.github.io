# G++

Best thing to do for g++ is consult the manual

| Flags |                             |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| -wall | will print out all warnings |
| -g    | enables debugging |

# GDB

I have been coding quite a bit lately for #leetcode30daychallenge and I choose mostly to do it in C++. 

I truly enjoy C++ and am enjoying both refreshing and learning new concepts about it. Let's jump in

### GDB 

| Name                      | Command  | What it does                                                 |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TUI (Text User Interface) | ctrl+x+a | it opens the Text User Interface of the GDB. the same thing as layot next or layout src. |
| layout next | layout next | Itterates to the next view layout |
| List | l or list | - prints out the source code centred around the line we are currently at |
| list + number line | l 13 | will print out the code centred around line 13 |
| Next | n or next | executes the next line of code |
| step | s or step | steps into the next line of code (for functions) |
| print  + variable name | p or print a | prints the content of a variable |
|  | p a = 2 | by using p and specifing the value of a variable, you can set the variable to a specific amount from GDB |
| info locals | info locals | Prints out all the local variables |
| breakpoint | b or break | it's good practice to set the file when using this, just to avoid confusion with multi file projects. for example b test.cpp:13 |
| disable break points | disable | disables all the break points |
| continue | c or continue | Continues to the next breakpoint or to the end of the file |

### -x flag
You can write a separate file containing all the comands to be executed within
gdb. This can be loaded with the -x flag.

```
# a.db
b  3
b 24

define sumA
    print $arg1 + $arg2 + $arg3
end
```

This will put a break point at location 3 and 24 and define the function sumA
that returns the sum of 3 arguments. In gdb the sum can be called 
```
(gdb) sumA 1 2 3
```
