# G++

Best thing to do for g++ is consult the manual `$man g++`

| Flags |                             |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| `-Wall` | will print out all warnings |
| `-g`  | enables debugging |
| `-ftime-report` | Nice little report at the end - very useful when testing the time and space results of the GCC passes and phases |
| **-fmem-report** | Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory allocation when it finishes. |
|  |  |
| **-time** | Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation sequence. For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler (plus the linker if linking is done). |
| `-l` | lets the compiler know what other libraries to use |
| `-I` | guides the compiler to the folder where it can find the include files |
| `-o` | sets the output of the process |
| `-O 0` | Turns off the  optimisation - useful when debugging |
| `-E` | do the Pre-Processing operation - this will just output it to the terminal if you want to catch the output you either do a `>` in the terminal or set a `-o` flag. |
| `-S` | takes the **Pre-compiled** file and transforms into **Assembly** - many times I find it quite interesting to read what the assembly code is doing in specific instances. It's worth noting that this can also be read by using the `gdb`. |
| `-c` | takes whatever you feed to it - pre-compiles and transforms it into assembly  if needed. Then puts the **Assembler** to work into transforming the **Assembly** code into binary the default extension is `.o` and the files are called objects. This is what the machine actually reads. The |
| ` $g++` | just worth mentinoning that when you call `g++` the linker will link every file  that is in its input. |
| **-v** | Verbose mode. Print out GNU CPP 's version number at the beginning of execution, and report the final form of the include path. |
| **-H** | Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal activities. Each name is indented to show how deep in the **#include** stack it is. Precompiled header files are also printed, even if they are found to be  invalid; an invalid precompiled header file is printed with **...x** and a valid one with **...!** . |



| Libraries | these libraries can be found at the path: **`/usr/include/GL/`** this is the default path that G++ will use in finding the libraries that are called with `-l` |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-lGL`    | OpenGL library                                               |
| `-lGLEW`  | GLEW library                                                 |
| `-lSDL2`  | LSDL 2 library                                               |

It is worth saying that the terminal reads **g++** from `/usr/bin` and this can be tested with running `which g++`. 

# GDB

I have been coding quite a bit lately for #leetcode30daychallenge and I choose
mostly to do it in C++. 

I truly enjoy C++ and am enjoying both refreshing and learning new concepts
about it. Let's jump in

### GDB oftenly used commands

| Name                      | Command  | What it does                                                 |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TUI (Text User Interface) | `ctrl+x+a` | it opens the Text User Interface of the GDB. the same thing as layot next or layout src. |
| layout next | `layout next` | Iterates to the next view layout |
| List | `l` or `list` | - prints out the source code centred around the line we are currently at |
| list + number line | `l 13` | will print out the code centred around line 13 |
| Next | `n` or `next` | executes the next line of code |
| step | `s` or `step` | steps into the next line of code (for functions) |
| print  + variable name | `p` or `print a` | prints the content of a variable |
|  | `p a = 2` | by using p and specifying the value of a variable, you can set the variable to a specific amount from **GDB** |
|set var |`set var x = 2`|Sets a specific variable to a specific value|
| info locals | `info locals` | Prints out all the local variables |
| breakpoint | `b` or `break` | it's good practice to set the file when using this, just to avoid confusion with multi file projects. for example `b test.cpp:13` |
| disable break points | `disable` | disables all the `breakpoints` |
| continue | `c` or `continue` | Continues to the next `breakpoint` or to the end of the file |

## Breaks
You can add conditional breaks like `b if (i==4)` and the program will break
when `i==4`.

## -x flag
You can write a separate file containing all the commands to be executed within
gdb. This can be loaded with the -x flag.

```
# a.db
b  3
b 24

define sumA
    print $arg1 + $arg2 + $arg3
end
```

This will put a break point at location 3 and 24 and define the function sumA
that returns the sum of 3 arguments. In gdb the sum can be called 
```
(gdb) sumA 1 2 3
```
