# Symlinks

Good article on the subject can be found at:

## Hardlink
A hardlink is much like a pointer to the same information, which in this case it is called inode. 

## Symlink
A symlink is much more like a classical shortcut. 
In order to create a symlink all you need to do is: 
```
ln -s <source> <linkname>
```
