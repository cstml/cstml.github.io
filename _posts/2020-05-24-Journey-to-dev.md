# Intro

### The goal
The goal is to find my first job as a python software developer - ideally a data
scientist.

### The motivation
Although currently I code and study mathematics in my spare time - with all my
attempts to integrate it in my day job as an architect, I always feel like I
don't have enough time or scope to truly code and math-out as much as I would
like to. Which makes me feel deflated at the end of the day and unsatisfied.

### The format
I will update this one post throughout the journey striving to write each day,
either about what I learnt or what I have done to get closer to achieving my
goal. I will take the liberty of editing stuff as I go, and by no measure will
this be perfect and the format will be quite fluid. Within the analysis, I will
try to be as honest as I can with what I  am thinking and steps I am taking,
however uncomfortable and *cringy* that makes me feel, in the hope that it will
be a more authentic case study of the process.

# 22 Jul 2020

I have just accepted my offer to study at Bristol. I have been pondering it for
a while now. It feels exciting, yet a bit scary. In any case we shall see where
this takes me.

I have yet to discuss with my current work about it.

It does feel a lot less monumental than one would think such a decision would
be, maybe due to the fact that it has been in the making for a while.

# 14 Jul 2020

Not much progress has been made since the last post. I hae been climbing and
spending some time with my family after the unfortunate event. 

Furtermore, I am having last minute doubts about the Masters programme due to
CoVID 19. Planning in these times seems a lot more complicated than I wanted it
to be. 

# 10 Jul 2020

I have 2 weeks left to confirm my attendance of university. Bristol is the main choice. LinkedIN seems to be flodded with developers searching for a job. COVID is showing its teeth. Times are a bit sketchy, and worrying.

I've been oscillating between worrying and thinking too far ahead these days. It seems as though I am caught in indecision. My gut feeling is that I should commit to it, and figure it out as I go. Probably what I should do. One thing is sure: there is no clear path. 

# 7 Jul 2020

A family related event has slowed down my job search progress, and for a few days I did not manage to do much coding. I've been experimenting prior to this with:

- Web Stuff 
  - PHP
    - Laravel
  - Jekyll
  - mySQL
- C++
  - OpenGL

### Achieved:

- [x]  finished the 30 day coding challenge on leetcode, succesfully completing each day.
- [x] Createad a simple **PHP** twitter clone - mostly the backend will work a bit more on this at some point
- [x] One step closer to going to Uni

###  Salesforce Job:

It's worth discussing my interview for a Sales Force developer. A couple weeks ago after applying to several jobs, I received a phone call from a Sales Force job advert. This transformed into an interview. 

Following the intial phone-call I had another interview, which then qualified me for a coding test. Funny thing with it, the lady I was talking to said: 

"*Don't worry it's really easy. You can do it after work, and I'll make it so you have 90 minutes*"

So I thought, OK, that's a piece of cake then especially since I chose to do it in Python with which I am fairly comfortable. So I started the test at 22:00, thinking it will be a chill activity to do in the evening. **Big mistake!** It was both hard and easy, but some of the questions required intense and fast thinking and some were super technical with very grey zone answers. To add to all of this, I only had 60 minutes. It was intense, and by the end of it I was *cream crackered* . I sent the lady an email that I completed it and went to bed. I was so tired I could not even remeber what I had done.

The next day, lady calls me: 

"*Hi Vlad, how do you think you did?*"

I had no clue, but was hoping to have at least passed. To my surprise she let me know that I achieved something la 71% correctness on the test and I was the fourth out of a cohort of more than 30 people. She then offered me the next interview in a few days time (this was meant to be the before last one). I was quite excited and prepared for it. 

On the day, she called to let me know that due to COVID-19 they were no longer looking for a sales-force developer and that once this situation changes she will get in contact with me to see my availability and continue the interview process. 

#### Lesson learnt 

- covid-19 is starting to show its claws

Nevertheless, the story and this post will carry on.

# 26 Jun 2020

**Day ?**

*Yes, I know, I've lost count of the days and also I am too tired to count them*

Had my first second phone interview. It all went well.

I have now also finished my second technical interview. Still waiting on two more universities to respond as well. One way or another, I have managed recorded significant gains in programming skills since the start of this process. It has been fun.

Thus I am carrying on.

### Achieved

- [x] maintained momentum
- [x] Phone interviews
- [x] two code challenges

### Not achieved

- [x] Find a job in C++



# Day 23

2020-06-19

I am busy busy busy busy busy.

### Achieved 

- [x] leetcode problems
- [x] started work on a clone of asteroids game
  - [x] managed to find a simple and fast multimedia library to work with that I find intuitive it is called SFML (Simple Fast Multimedia Library)  ... I love it
  - [x] I am developing the game without the use of any tutorial or guide - just with the use of the reference, CTags and VIM. It is **very** rewarding
- [x] Managed to find a second academic reference for my master's  course  - one of the referees has actually submitted their reference as well

### Not Achieved

- [ ] Have any sort of free time to write this post

# Days 14-20
2020-06-10 - 2020-06-16

Carry on programming every day, and mostly C++. Leetcode 30 day coding challenge has had some more challenging problems. I've started developing some of my own libraries to use in the solving of the leetcode problems. 

I've stopped applying for jobs, as I have been too busy to do it properly. I am focusing on applying to two more universities and carrying on studying in my spare time. ~~None of the sent applications have come back, and the recruiter that was offering me a potential job has "ghosted" me~~ (Updated: spoke a bit too soon, the job has actually come back and I have a code challenge lined up for Saturday, I am super excited about this, as it is an incredible opportunity in a fantastic office working with what I love the most - C++). 

### Achieved

- [x] Day 15 out of 30 of Daily Code Challenge on Leetcode and going strong
- [x] I have managed to secure one academic referral for my  MSc

### Not Achieved

- [ ] Applying for more jobs

---
# Days 13-16

2020-06-06 - 2020-06-09

I have been coding on a daily basis, mostly C++. Working with C++ and really 
diving into the deeper concepts- on which I only touched upon in the past like:
- memory allocation 
- polymorphism
- function pointers
- templates

By doing so I am enjoying C++ even more.

Regarding job-hunting, I have received a negative response from the company that
I solved their website's challenge (that's a bit of a shame). I was hoping for 
at least an interview or a conversation about it. Nevertheless, I should carry
on applying for other jobs. 

I have started my third university application and I am hoping to finish it by the
end of today. Leetcode 30 day code challenge is continuing in  the background 
and if you have been watching me on twitter, you know my trials and
tribulations. In a nutshell I am still in it, and very busy.

To fill in my gaps regarding web-dev, I have been experimenting with a LAMPS
server, deployed on an AWS EC2, learning PHP and practicing MySQL. I intend to 
create a simple website that users can input jokes and see all the jokes
written by others.

#### Achieved
- [x] submitted on Kaggle an example worked out through reading other people's 
notebooks. It was very useful to learn how other people arrive at the results
and how to implement the algorithms. It was also much easier to find what to
research in terms of ML algorithms, rather than reading only the documentations.
Lesson learnt - read other people's code .
- [x] kept at it with Leetcode and refining my C++ skills
- [x] maintained motivation and momentum

#### Not achieved
- [ ] Apply or look for more jobs over the weekend. I will be honest, job searching
takes a long time, and applying for each job takes even longer. I'd rather code
or do something else rather than apply for a job sometimes, and with no expression
of interest from any of the applications sent out (especially the one that I even
completed their challenge that was meant to make them interested) I have lost some
of the motivation needed to invest the time in applying. Nevertheless, I am aware that
this is how job searching works, and should not be discouraged. I will get back to it
as soon as possible - maybe why not - today.

# Day 10-12

2020-06-03 - 2020-06-05

Managed to do two more problems for the Leet Code  challenge - I am now truly
hooked and will win that t-shirt! the third day of the challenge took a bit
more thinking, and I did it in Python, but the rest have been consistently easy
- for more instantaneous updates, please head to my twitter or to my
leetcode-practice repo.

In other updates, my first position refusal has also come through, one of the
places I have applied to notifying me that they have now made an offer to a
person. This actually doesn't bother me, and I much prefer to know that this is
the case rather than never even find out if my application was even seen. 

I've also looked into Functional Programming, which sounds like a good idea,
although I am not very confident I could apply it at this point. Nevertheless,
there are concepts that I did pick up. I've also spent one evening refreshing
myself on C++ lists and strings, which was much fun, especially whilst having
sum Pizza (yum).

I've been contacted yesterday (2020-05-05) by a  recruiter wanting to discuss
the possibility of a job with C++ and Python at the heart of it. The job
description seemed amazing, and it got me really excited. I have replied to the
recruiter but have yet received a response back. I hope it wasn't a scam, and
if it was, I am yet to figure out what they gain out of doing so. Will wait and
    see.

I am keeping my spirits up, and remaining positive. I am feeling less under
pressure compared to last week, and have now changed my mindset. Realising that
I was burning out a little bit, I reminded myself that I am doing this because
I am truly passionate about programming and solving problems - and thus should
enjoy the journey rather than only concentrate on the final goal. It was an
important realisation, and it has changed my experience for good.

#### Achieved

- [x] I have further applied for another university  MSc - Bristol
- [x] Kept at it with the Leetcode Challenge
- [x] Finalised and gained a certificate in MongoDB - M001: MongoDB Basics; for now I feel quite literate within mongoDB and would recommend the course to anyone who wants to refresh or learn non-relational databases. The course is structured in a fantastic way, the exams are engaging, and it is completely free. A great course that I recommend 

#### To Do

- [ ] Apply for more jobs - I seam to have applied less often and to fewer places; probably because I have been concentrating on learning more and also applying for master's course - I have lost some of my initial inertia when it comes to applying because i feel like it takes a bit of time, and potentially no one fully reads the application. With this being said, it shouldn't demotivate myself from applying.
- [ ] Finalise or do some more work on my Kaggle Titanic pet project - I know I have set off on this journey planning to work on it, and somehow managed to only work a couple days on it. It is quite challenging to pick it up after a full day of work, as I would like to be able to fully concentrate on it. With this being said, I might change my approach on it, and use Keras to apply some 'quick and dirty' ML to resolve it. Nevertheless, the problem has pushed me to learn and research the Bayes Theorem (do go and read my post about it) and the amount of info learned only from that is priceless. It's all part of the process.
- [ ] Have a go at learning JavaScript - a project for next week
- [ ] Apply for a couple more MSc Computer Science courses

# Day 9
2020-06-02

Interview went seamlessly and I received a spot on the Makers cohort. I have
been thinking a lot about it and I don't know if it will be a good step at 
this time. I will keep thinking about it

In other news, the #30DayCodeChallenge is going strong, and the last problem 
was a 2 liner. It was a very satisfying 5 minute exercise, and it worked on
the first submission spot on. Although easy, I think keeping at it so good, especially when it comes to confidence. I will try and keep this going for as long as possible.

#### Achieved:

- [x] Passed the Makers Academy Interview in Ruby(!), yes I managed to pick up as much Ruby as I could in 2 days. It was enough to be able to solve all of the problems 
- [x] Finished the last chapter of M001: MongoDB Basics
- [x] Day 2 of leetcode 30 day code challenge (chose to do it in C++ this time as well)
- [x] Sent out another job application - for which I would like to thank my friend Gem for letting me know about
- [x] Uploaded all the documents for Imp. College Lon.

# Day 8

2020-06-01

Today was quite productive, and it also was the first day of my #30daycodechallenge. I'm posting updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cstml1). 
#### Achieved:

- [x] I have improved my CV and Cover Letter

- [x] First day of #30DayCodeChallenge on LeetCode - first problem done (chose to do it in C++)

- [x] Ready to submit for Imperial College for MSc in Comp Sci.

- [x] Ready to submit for other universities  

- [x] Put in some more work towards my M0001:MongoDB certificate :muscle:

  ​	- on this last one, going through the course has really improved my understanding of querying non-relational databases. It's quite a lot of fun !

#### New

I am interviewing for *Makers Academy* tomorrow, and the interview will take place in **Ruby**. I've been looking over its syntax, and feel like I have a good grasp of the fundamentals. It does feel like the more programming languages you know, the easier it is to swap between them.  We'll see how the 'view goes tomorrow.

# Day 6-7
2020-05-31

Managed to send out one more application, and started my Imperial College
London application. I've been busy documenting myself on MongoDB, and started
their *M001: MongoDB course*.

To manage my learning, and applications I am trying to replicate a *Sprint
based* system. Now I have a cardboard with tons of sticky notes trying to make
it to the *finish*. It seems like a good idea for now, and certainly is helping
with keeping myself on track. 

I am considering doing the 30 days Coding Challenge on Leet Code. I think it
might be a great idea, will give it a shot.

#### Achieved
- [x] Wrote my application to Imperial College and managed to gather the
information required. 
- [ ] Finalise the Personal Statement (not yet)
- [x] 2/3 of the M001: MongoDB Basics course done

#### Thoughts
I am unsure about the right way to go about it. A master's course would 
probably grow my employability, but so would a job in a company. I am 
hoping that the applications that I have already sent out will return
and I will have a better understanding of the curent situation. Ideally
I would get admitted to Imperial for this year's master's and find 
an internship in the meantime.

# Day 5
2020-05-29

It is official, the first application has gone out. After scouting for a
place, I have found a company in London, that is incredibly close to what I
would love doing and working in. Hopefully they will be as excited about me
working there as I am about myself working there.

The interesting thing about it is that they had a challenge on their website,
that after I solved it gave me a reference code. This got me even more excited
about the prospect of working in such a place. I will keep the name of the
company private for now, but wish me good luck and fingers crossed. It was trimenduous fun, 
and makes the process a lot more engaging than simply trawling the web for jobs.

#### Achieved
- Managed to pull together the CV
- Managed to get the first application out the door
- Started a twitter, for small updates and to follow people with a common
  interest

#### Small note
It is quiet riveting, applying for jobs. It took a lot of courage and
commitment to press that send button. I feel a lot better now.

#### Newly found interest and possible project for the weekend
A few ideas have popped up today, and I have gathered some momentum 
yet again that could take me off my path. I have been trying to learn and
understand how a framework like Django works, then I started trying to write
my own framework while thinking of enrolling int he LeeCode June Challenge of
30 days with 30 problems solved. Even as I write this I realise it is a bit much,
when I already started the Kaggle Challenge, and am looking for jobs while 
still having a full time job. **SO**, I will try to Keep It Simple and reduce. To be 
able to do this, I've decided to create a queue, which will work following these rules:
~(probably a bit like Kanban)~ (actually a lot more like SCRUM)

1. I am not able to start a new project until one is finished from the **working on** queue
2. No more than **2 working on** projects
3. I am allowed to look for new stufff, just to satisfy my constant "poking" curiosity, but
anything more than 20 minutes is no good. Pass 20 minutes add id to the **to look at** queue

That's about it - I will probaly implement it on github projects. As it is quite nifty and easily
accessible.

# Day 3-4
2020-05-27
2020-05-28
Spent these days getting in contact with people working in the industry and trying to understand
(which I would like to thank for taking the time to speak to me) what would be an
efficient way of proceeding given my strengths and weaknesses. I am now considering 
potentially returnig to University to do a Master's Degree in CS, to
a. Give me some extra time to develop a solid project
b. Give me some extra confidence in the knowledge and a solid base to grow on.

I am considering atm this option, and will keep you posted with how it goes. 
Given the late time, it might need to be offset to next year, and by then 
situation might be completely different. I am yet sure about how to proceed, but 
it is worth keeping in mind. 

I have also singed up for a Makers Meeting in Lodnon in June - a bootcamp session in 
Ruby. I am using Ruby for this Jekyll website (that you are on) but am not very familliar with the
Rails framework or with Ruby for that matter. The meeting is next week so that is one more 
thing to add to my queue. So many things that I want to learn, yet so little time.

---
# Day 2
2020-05-26

Back to my current job today, so I have less time to write these posts. I have used the time after
work to write my CV, draft out a cover letter and do some job scouting. After reaching out
to friends that work or have worked in the tech industry I have looked into
potentially joining a Masters degree - still doing some due diligence on that. Might consider 
swapping evening working routine to early morning working. 

### Achieved
1. Did some research into Regressions at lunch, planning to write an article on
linear regression in the upcoming days
2. Wrote 80% of my CV
3. Drafted a rough cover letter, explaining my motivations and whatnot

### Aims
0. Write the article on Linear Regression
1. Maintain momentum
2. Try to sketch out a schedulle to achieve progress in the morning, prior to starting my day job
3. Do not get discouraged

---
# Day 1
2020-05-25

I have spent the day researching and understanding Bayes Theory. I feel like I
have an idea of how I can apply it in my Kaggle pet project. Today I made
significant progress and it felt like a productive day good grasp of it and
look forward to applying it within my Kaggle. I have also changed the
Jupyter-notebook of the project to a public one, in the hope to use it as a
portfolio piece. I am still holding back from finalising my CV and/or sending it
out to apply for jobs. I am hoping by the end of day 7 to at least send one out.


### Achieved
1. First mathematical and theoretical post on the blog
   [Bayes Theorem Post Link](https://cstml.github.io/mathematics/2020/05/24/Bayes-Theorem.html)
2. A good understanding of Bayes Theorem
3. Surfaced KTC

### Worried about
1. The time it takes to create these posts so they don't look skittish

---
# Day 0 
2020-05-24

I have been considering the swap for years now, and if I wait any longer it
will be a decade. But yesterday I have finally decided that I need to commit
and go ahead with it. I am going to pursue landing my first, proper job, within
the world of Computer Science and Software Development. Although passionate
about it since childhood, and indeed active in the field both as a past time
and "educational entertainment" and with a drive to constantly integrate it
into my day job, I have somehow always managed to coward out of actively
searching for a pure developer job. Call it fear of rejection, lack of time and
determination or simply not the right moment.

To make sure that I am going to commit 99.(99)% this time, I will keep this
blog post going and record my activity. Hopefully it will motivate me, and at
the same time, be a good case study (of failure or success) for other people
that are in a similar position but are too afraid (as I am) to fully commit.
I'm sure there will be lessons to learn from my own mistakes, so maybe this
will help both me and you- which as I write this, in my head is me but from the
future. 

### Achieved
1. Started the blog post
2. Worked on Kaggle-Titanic competition pet-project (from now on referred to as
   KTC)
  - Developed a better understanding of working with the pandas library but
    still need to research fast ways of manipulating the data within


### Current Level
I feel confident with my understanding level C++/C, and Python for basic and
intermediate tasks. I would even go as far as to say that although not in an
elegant or time efficient manner, I'm confident I can come up with and/or hack
a method of solving most basic fundamental algorithms by using my current
skills. I usually lack the determination to finalise or refine most of the pet
projects I start, due to a combination of available time and the constant
strive to start and learn something new - which gets me well excited. 

I have been using either Linux (different distros including ArchLinux, Fedora,
Debian with Ubuntu being my main OS at the moment) or MacOS for years now, and
love using the terminal for small projects and/or educational procrastination.
As you can hopefully tell from my GitHUB, I have a working understanding of the
concept of versioning, and version control (which I am an absolute fan of, and
tried bringing into the world of architecture). 

These skills have been gathered over time and a passion for tinkering around. I
can't put my finger on when I've learnt any of the above, but rather I consider
them to have just occurred over the years.

I am not as confident, but I am passionately curious and interested in AI and
ML. At the intersection of Mathematics and CS, I have always wanted to work
within this realm (more on this, hopefully will be written in the background
section at some point). 

### Aims
Thus:
1. Focus my educational efforts going forward into developing a good
   understanding of AI/ML and how to apply it
2. Focus my attention on one pet-project rather than try and start new one
   after new one

---

#### Why does this matter?
I guess it doesn't matter much, in the real sense for anyone else except
myself. I am completely out of my comfort zone writing about this on the
internet, as I consider myself quite an introverted person, and certainly
suffer from the "spectator anxiety". I am trying to use that exposure to
"uncomfortable" to keep me posting and moving into the direction of achieving
the goal. If you are reading this (as you can tell I am also an *optimist*,
thinking that someone else would read this) and it motivates you to follow that
one path that you always wanted to, then maybe it's not useless after all.
