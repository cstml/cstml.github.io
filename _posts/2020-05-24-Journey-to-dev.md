# Intro

### The goal
The goal, as previously mentioned is to find my first job as a developer. 

### The motivation
Although currently I code and study mathematics in my spare time - with all my attempts to integrate it in my day job as an architect, I always feel like I don't have enough time or scope to truly code and math-out as much as I would like to. Which makes me feel deflated at the end of the day and unsatisfied.

### The format
I will update this one post throughout the journey striving to write each day, either about what I learnt or what I have done to get closer to achieving my goal. I will take the liberty of editing stuff as I go, and by no measure will this be perfect. But it will be good enough for the aforementioned 

# Day 0
I have been considering the swap for years now, and if I wait any longer it will be a decade. But yesterday I have finally decided that I need to commit and go ahead with it. I am going to pursue landing my first, proper job, within the world of Computer Science and Development.Although passionate about it since childhood, and indeed active in the field both as a past time and "educational entertainment" and with a drive to constantly integrate it into my day job, I have somehow always managed to coward out of actively searhcing for a pure developer job. Call it fear of rejection or, 

To make sure that I am going to commit 99% this time I will keep this blog post going and record my activity. Hopefully it will motivate me, and at the same time, be a good case study for other people that are passionate about CS but are too afraid (as I am) to fully commit. 

### Background
Since childhood I have always been passionate about both computers and mathematics. I grew up in Romania, and personal computers were not easily available. But I was lucky enough that my mother, my aunt and uncle were teachers and their school bought their first computers around 1995, when I was 2. By the age of 4 I was a common occurence in their systems room, playing on the schools **Pentium 486**. Seeing my relentless interest in computers, my mother spoke to the schools computer science teacher and managed to secure me Turbo Pascal tuitions. And this was the beginning of my journey in the world of computers. 

From that point, my interest exploded exponentially and I started to attend our local "Children's Palace". If you are wondering, in the 90's Romania, Children's Palace was a local club where children could go after school and enroll in all sorts of extra-curricular activities - the fee was small if any. And so I was going daily after my classes and spending 3-4 hours attending classes like Informatics (where we would learn turbo Pascal and C), Radio-Amateurs (where we would learn Morse Code transmissions, use it on a Morse Code Paddle and hopefully - take our HAM radio exam - never did that sadly), electronics (where we would create circuits from scratch and toys). I haven't thought about those days much until now, when I sat down to write this post, but it was fantastic!

To add to all of the above, my uncle is a mathematics teacher. Together with my cousin, which is of the same age as me, he was always happy and available to teach us mathematics (even when we were not as happy or available to do it - for all that matters haha). But by the age of 10, both me and her were enroled in all the mathematics competitions happening in our city, county or neighbouring counties. It probably culminated with my qualification to the county phase of the Mathematics Olympics in 2007, at which I have a tragicomedy story about myself - which maybe I will discuss in another post. 

The school Olympics are the biggest and most pretigious competition in Romania, they are done for each curricular class or activity, and happen only once a year, every year. Each child competes against peers that are in the same school year as they are, and there is a triage starting from class phase (which usually does not happen, as the best in each class are usually the ones that go) going to school phase (usually happens if the school has more participants than positions alocated for the school), followed by city phase, county phase and then national phase. From each phase usually two children would manage to go through to the next phase. So high is the prestige of this competion that Romanian Universities will offer you an unpaid slot within a course of the same subject by default, if you qualify to the national phase once during your 4 years of college. With 41 counties in Romania, and Suceava being in the top 10 most populous, the competition was fierce.

Needless to say, I was pretty hooked by the two subjects and by the time I had to go to college, there was no other option for me but the Mathematics and Computer Science specialisation. I was fortunate to go to both one of the top colleges in the county, and one of the classes with talented passionate and gifted peers in the country. From a collective of 31 people, we had national and international phase Olympic competitiors in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Modern Romanian. This class was so good at CS that out of 6 places for the city phase of Suceava 5 were my peers, one of which I was lucky enough to be as well. We were also lucky enough to have two of the best CS teachers, one of which was our class's head teacher. Our head teacher was not only passionate about CS and algorithms, she absolutely loved it and was incredible at it! She was a true inspiration for me and my fellow competitors (which were now my friends), and our performance would have never been possible if not her talent and dedication. But again, the competition was fierce!
