# Intro

### The goal
The goal is to find my first job as a python software developer - ideally a data
scientist.

### The motivation
Although currently I code and study mathematics in my spare time - with all my
attempts to integrate it in my day job as an architect, I always feel like I
don't have enough time or scope to truly code and math-out as much as I would
like to. Which makes me feel deflated at the end of the day and unsatisfied.

### The format
I will update this one post throughout the journey striving to write each day,
either about what I learnt or what I have done to get closer to achieving my
goal. I will take the liberty of editing stuff as I go, and by no measure will
this be perfect and the format will be quite fluid. Within the analysis, I will
try to be as honest as I can with what I  am thinking and steps I am taking,
however uncomfortable and *cringy* that makes me feel, in the hope that it will
be a more authentic case study of the process.

# Day 1
2020-05-25

I have spent the day researching and understanding Bayes Theory. I feel like I
have an idea of how I can apply it in my Kaggle pet project. Today I made
significant progress and it felt like a productive day good grasp of it and
look forward to applying it within my Kaggle. I have also changed the
Jupyter-notebook of the project to a public one, in the hope to use it as a
portfolio piece. I am still holding back from finalising my CV and/or sending it
out to apply for jobs. I am hoping by the end of day 7 to at least send one out.


### Achieved
1. First mathematical and theoretical post on the blog
   [Bayes Theorem Post Link](www.cstml.github.io/bayes-theorem)
2. A good understanding of Bayes Theorem
3. Surfaced KTC

### Worried about
1. The time it takes to create these posts so they don't look skittish

# Day 0 
2020-05-24

I have been considering the swap for years now, and if I wait any longer it
will be a decade. But yesterday I have finally decided that I need to commit
and go ahead with it. I am going to pursue landing my first, proper job, within
the world of Computer Science and Software Development. Although passionate
about it since childhood, and indeed active in the field both as a past time
and "educational entertainment" and with a drive to constantly integrate it
into my day job, I have somehow always managed to coward out of actively
searching for a pure developer job. Call it fear of rejection, lack of time and
determination or simply not the right moment.

To make sure that I am going to commit 99.(99)% this time, I will keep this
blog post going and record my activity. Hopefully it will motivate me, and at
the same time, be a good case study (of failure or success) for other people
that are in a similar position but are too afraid (as I am) to fully commit.
I'm sure there will be lessons to learn from my own mistakes, so maybe this
will help both me and you- which as I write this, in my head is me but from the
future. 

### Achieved
1. Started the blog post
2. Worked on Kaggle-Titanic competition pet-project (from now on referred to as
   KTC)
  - Developed a better understanding of working with the pandas library but
    still need to research fast ways of manipulating the data within
  

### Current Level
I feel confident with my understanding level C++/C, and Python for basic and
intermediate tasks. I would even go as far as to say that although not in an
elegant or time efficient manner, I'm confident I can come up with and/or hack
a method of solving most basic fundamental algorithms by using my current
skills. I usually lack the determination to finalise or refine most of the pet
projects I start, due to a combination of available time and the constant
strive to start and learn something new - which gets me well excited. 

I have been using either Linux (different distros including ArchLinux, Fedora,
Debian with Ubuntu being my main OS at the moment) or MacOS for years now, and
love using the terminal for small projects and/or educational procrastination.
As you can hopefully tell from my GitHUB, I have a working understanding of the
concept of versioning, and version control (which I am an absolute fan of, and
tried bringing into the world of architecture). 

These skills have been gathered over time and a passion for tinkering around. I
can't put my finger on when I've learnt any of the above, but rather I consider
them to have just occurred over the years.

I am not as confident, but I am passionately curious and interested in AI and
ML. At the intersection of Mathematics and CS, I have always wanted to work
within this realm (more on this, hopefully will be written in the background
section at some point). 

### Aims
Thus:
1. Focus my educational efforts going forward into developing a good
   understanding of AI/ML and how to apply it
2. Focus my attention on one pet-project rather than try and start new one
   after new one

#### Why does this matter?
I guess it doesn't matter much, in the real sense for anyone else except
myself. I am completely out of my comfort zone writing about this on the
internet, as I consider myself quite an introverted person, and certainly
suffer from the "spectator anxiety". I am trying to use that exposure to
"uncomfortable" to keep me posting and moving into the direction of achieving
the goal. If you are reading this (as you can tell I am also an *optimist*,
thinking that someone else would read this) and it motivates you to follow that
one path that you always wanted to, then maybe it's not useless after all.
