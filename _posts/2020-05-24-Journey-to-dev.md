# Intro

### The goal
The goal is to find my first job as a python software developer - ideally a data
scientist.

### The motivation
Although currently I code and study mathematics in my spare time - with all my
attempts to integrate it in my day job as an architect, I always feel like I
don't have enough time or scope to truly code and math-out as much as I would
like to. Which makes me feel deflated at the end of the day and unsatisfied.

### The format
I will update this one post throughout the journey striving to write each day,
either about what I learnt or what I have done to get closer to achieving my
goal. I will take the liberty of editing stuff as I go, and by no measure will
this be perfect and the format will be quite fluid. Within the analysis, I will
try to be as honest as I can with what I  am thinking and steps I am taking,
however uncomfortable and *cringy* that makes me feel, in the hope that it will
be a more authentic case study of the process.

# Day 8

2020-05-01

Today was quite productive, and it also was the first day of my #30daycodechallenge. I'm posting updates on (https://twitter.com/Cstml1) [Twitter]. 

#### Achieved:

- [x] I have improved my CV and Cover Letter

- [x] First day of #30DayCodeChallenge on LeetCode - first problem done (chose to do it in C++)

- [x] Ready to submit for Imperial College for MSc in Comp Sci.

- [x] Ready to submit for other universities ... I am looking at Bristol, 

- [x] Put in some more work towards my M0001:MongoDB certificate :muscle:

  â€‹	- on this last one, going through the course has really improved my understanding of querying non-relational databases. It's quite a lot of fun !

#### New

I am interviewing for *Makers Academy* tomorrow, and the interview will take place in **Ruby**. I've been looking over its syntax, and feel like I have a good grasp of the fundamentals. It does feel like the more programming languages you know, the easier it is to swap between them.  We'll see how the 'view goes tomorrow.

# Day 6-7
2020-05-31

Managed to send out one more application, and started my Imperial College
London application. I've been busy documenting myself on MongoDB, and started
their *M001: MongoDB course*.

To manage my learning, and applications I am trying to replicate a *Sprint
based* system. Now I have a cardboard with tons of sticky notes trying to make
it to the *finish*. It seems like a good idea for now, and certainly is helping
with keeping myself on track. 

I am considering doing the 30 days Coding Challenge on Leet Code. I think it
might be a great idea, will give it a shot.

#### Achieved
- [x] Wrote my application to Imperial College and managed to gather the
information required. 
- [ ] Finalise the Personal Statement (not yet)
- [x] 2/3 of the M001: MongoDB Basics course done

#### Thoughts
I am unsure about the right way to go about it. A master's course would 
probably grow my employability, but so would a job in a company. I am 
hoping that the applications that I have already sent out will return
and I will have a better understanding of the curent situation. Ideally
I would get admitted to Imperial for this year's master's and find 
an internship in the meantime.

# Day 5
2020-05-29

It is official, the first application has gone out. After scouting for a
place, I have found a company in London, that is incredibly close to what I
would love doing and working in. Hopefully they will be as excited about me
working there as I am about myself working there.

The interesting thing about it is that they had a challenge on their website,
that after I solved it gave me a reference code. This got me even more excited
about the prospect of working in such a place. I will keep the name of the
company private for now, but wish me good luck and fingers crossed. It was trimenduous fun, 
and makes the process a lot more engaging than simply trawling the web for jobs.

#### Achieved
- Managed to pull together the CV
- Managed to get the first application out the door
- Started a twitter, for small updates and to follow people with a common
  interest

#### Small note
It is quiet riveting, applying for jobs. It took a lot of courage and
commitment to press that send button. I feel a lot better now.

#### Newly found interest and possible project for the weekend
A few ideas have popped up today, and I have gathered some momentum 
yet again that could take me off my path. I have been trying to learn and
understand how a framework like Django works, then I started trying to write
my own framework while thinking of enrolling int he LeeCode June Challenge of
30 days with 30 problems solved. Even as I write this I realise it is a bit much,
when I already started the Kaggle Challenge, and am looking for jobs while 
still having a full time job. **SO**, I will try to Keep It Simple and reduce. To be 
able to do this, I've decided to create a queue, which will work following these rules:
~(probably a bit like Kanban)~ (actually a lot more like SCRUM)

1. I am not able to start a new project until one is finished from the **working on** queue
2. No more than **2 working on** projects
3. I am allowed to look for new stufff, just to satisfy my constant "poking" curiosity, but
anything more than 20 minutes is no good. Pass 20 minutes add id to the **to look at** queue

That's about it - I will probaly implement it on github projects. As it is quite nifty and easily
accessible.

# Day 3-4
2020-05-27
2020-05-28
Spent these days getting in contact with people working in the industry and trying to understand
(which I would like to thank for taking the time to speak to me) what would be an
efficient way of proceeding given my strengths and weaknesses. I am now considering 
potentially returnig to University to do a Master's Degree in CS, to
a. Give me some extra time to develop a solid project
b. Give me some extra confidence in the knowledge and a solid base to grow on.

I am considering atm this option, and will keep you posted with how it goes. 
Given the late time, it might need to be offset to next year, and by then 
situation might be completely different. I am yet sure about how to proceed, but 
it is worth keeping in mind. 

I have also singed up for a Makers Meeting in Lodnon in June - a bootcamp session in 
Ruby. I am using Ruby for this Jekyll website (that you are on) but am not very familliar with the
Rails framework or with Ruby for that matter. The meeting is next week so that is one more 
thing to add to my queue. So many things that I want to learn, yet so little time.

# Day 2
2020-05-26

Back to my current job today, so I have less time to write these posts. I have used the time after
work to write my CV, draft out a cover letter and do some job scouting. After reaching out
to friends that work or have worked in the tech industry I have looked into
potentially joining a Masters degree - still doing some due diligence on that. Might consider 
swapping evening working routine to early morning working. 

### Achieved
1. Did some research into Regressions at lunch, planning to write an article on
linear regression in the upcoming days
2. Wrote 80% of my CV
3. Drafted a rough cover letter, explaining my motivations and whatnot

### Aims
0. Write the article on Linear Regression
1. Maintain momentum
2. Try to sketch out a schedulle to achieve progress in the morning, prior to starting my day job
3. Do not get discouraged

# Day 1
2020-05-25

I have spent the day researching and understanding Bayes Theory. I feel like I
have an idea of how I can apply it in my Kaggle pet project. Today I made
significant progress and it felt like a productive day good grasp of it and
look forward to applying it within my Kaggle. I have also changed the
Jupyter-notebook of the project to a public one, in the hope to use it as a
portfolio piece. I am still holding back from finalising my CV and/or sending it
out to apply for jobs. I am hoping by the end of day 7 to at least send one out.


### Achieved
1. First mathematical and theoretical post on the blog
   [Bayes Theorem Post Link](https://cstml.github.io/mathematics/2020/05/24/Bayes-Theorem.html)
2. A good understanding of Bayes Theorem
3. Surfaced KTC

### Worried about
1. The time it takes to create these posts so they don't look skittish

# Day 0 
2020-05-24

I have been considering the swap for years now, and if I wait any longer it
will be a decade. But yesterday I have finally decided that I need to commit
and go ahead with it. I am going to pursue landing my first, proper job, within
the world of Computer Science and Software Development. Although passionate
about it since childhood, and indeed active in the field both as a past time
and "educational entertainment" and with a drive to constantly integrate it
into my day job, I have somehow always managed to coward out of actively
searching for a pure developer job. Call it fear of rejection, lack of time and
determination or simply not the right moment.

To make sure that I am going to commit 99.(99)% this time, I will keep this
blog post going and record my activity. Hopefully it will motivate me, and at
the same time, be a good case study (of failure or success) for other people
that are in a similar position but are too afraid (as I am) to fully commit.
I'm sure there will be lessons to learn from my own mistakes, so maybe this
will help both me and you- which as I write this, in my head is me but from the
future. 

### Achieved
1. Started the blog post
2. Worked on Kaggle-Titanic competition pet-project (from now on referred to as
   KTC)
  - Developed a better understanding of working with the pandas library but
    still need to research fast ways of manipulating the data within


### Current Level
I feel confident with my understanding level C++/C, and Python for basic and
intermediate tasks. I would even go as far as to say that although not in an
elegant or time efficient manner, I'm confident I can come up with and/or hack
a method of solving most basic fundamental algorithms by using my current
skills. I usually lack the determination to finalise or refine most of the pet
projects I start, due to a combination of available time and the constant
strive to start and learn something new - which gets me well excited. 

I have been using either Linux (different distros including ArchLinux, Fedora,
Debian with Ubuntu being my main OS at the moment) or MacOS for years now, and
love using the terminal for small projects and/or educational procrastination.
As you can hopefully tell from my GitHUB, I have a working understanding of the
concept of versioning, and version control (which I am an absolute fan of, and
tried bringing into the world of architecture). 

These skills have been gathered over time and a passion for tinkering around. I
can't put my finger on when I've learnt any of the above, but rather I consider
them to have just occurred over the years.

I am not as confident, but I am passionately curious and interested in AI and
ML. At the intersection of Mathematics and CS, I have always wanted to work
within this realm (more on this, hopefully will be written in the background
section at some point). 

### Aims
Thus:
1. Focus my educational efforts going forward into developing a good
   understanding of AI/ML and how to apply it
2. Focus my attention on one pet-project rather than try and start new one
   after new one

#### Why does this matter?
I guess it doesn't matter much, in the real sense for anyone else except
myself. I am completely out of my comfort zone writing about this on the
internet, as I consider myself quite an introverted person, and certainly
suffer from the "spectator anxiety". I am trying to use that exposure to
"uncomfortable" to keep me posting and moving into the direction of achieving
the goal. If you are reading this (as you can tell I am also an *optimist*,
thinking that someone else would read this) and it motivates you to follow that
one path that you always wanted to, then maybe it's not useless after all.
