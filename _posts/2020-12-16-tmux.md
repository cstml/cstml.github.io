# `tmux`

Tmux was one of those things I never thought about and then I installed **iterm2** and all that jazz, but it was alway deeply usatisfying to have different bindings and capabilities on my mac to what I had on my debs

And then I discovered tmux ... Which is (debatably) the best way to use a terminal 

### Why use `tmux`

1. it is a server client application, if you detach from your session, you can always come back to it
2. it is cross platform
3. it works, it is boring, it is powerful

## Opening and closing `tmux`

1. I usually start a new session by doing `tmux new-session -s session-name`. I like keeping tidy and always open the session with whatever I am working on 
2. If i want to go to a different sesion I would either 
   1. detach from the session with `C-b d` OR close my curent session (keep them tidy)
   2. attach to the new one with `tmux attach-session -s session-name` or `tmx attach -s session-name`
3. `zsh` has nice autocomplete for session name but otherwise you can do `tmux list-session`

## Window Management & Most used

- the manual is pretty good, so I won't go through all of `man tmux` but these are the things i find myself using most of the time

| Flag                | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `C-b Arrowkeys`     | Change the Pane                                              |
| `C-b n`             | Next window                                                  |
| `C-b 2`             | Window 1                                                     |
| `C-b C-o`           | Rotate the window                                            |
| `C-b [`             | VIM mode (for looking around and copying) - this is fantastic |
| `C-b ]`             | Paste from window buffer                                     |
| `C-b {`             | Move pane to the left                                        |
| `C-d`               | This is how I usually close a pane- by calling SIGTERM on it |
| `C-b d`             | Detaches from the session                                    |
| `C-b w`             | Good way to select window if you are reaaaaly nested (tend not to use) |
| `C-b "` and `C-b %` | Split the window  vertical and horizonta                     |

### End note

I try to do everything in the terminal, and tmux has been a major major improvement to my workflow. Thoroughly recommend it
