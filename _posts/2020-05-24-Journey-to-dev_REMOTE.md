# Intro

### The goal
The goal is to find my first job as a software developer. 

### The motivation
Although currently I code and study mathematics in my spare time - with all my attempts to integrate it in my day job as an architect, I always feel like I don't have enough time or scope to truly code and math-out as much as I would like to. Which makes me feel deflated at the end of the day and unsatisfied.

### The format
I will update this one post throughout the journey striving to write each day, either about what I learnt or what I have done to get closer to achieving my goal. I will take the liberty of editing stuff as I go, and by no measure will this be perfect an the format will be quite fluid. Within the analysis, I will try to be as honest as I can with what I  am thinking and steps I am taking, however uncumfortable and *cringy* that makes me feel, in the hope that it will be a more authentic case study of the process.

# Day 0 
2020-05-24

I have been considering the swap for years now, and if I wait any longer it will be a decade. But yesterday I have finally decided that I need to commit and go ahead with it. I am going to pursue landing my first, proper job, within the world of Computer Science and Software Development. Although passionate about it since childhood, and indeed active in the field both as a past time and "educational entertainment" and with a drive to constantly integrate it into my day job, I have somehow always managed to coward out of actively searhcing for a pure developer job. Call it fear of rejection, lack of time and determination or simply not the right moment.

To make sure that I am going to commit 99.(99)% this time, I will keep this blog post going and record my activity. Hopefully it will motivate me, and at the same time, be a good case study (of failure or success) for other people that are in a similar position but are too afraid (as I am) to fully commit. I'm sure there will be lessons to learn from my own mistakes, so maybe this will help both me and you- which as I write this, in my head is me but from the future. 

### Achieved
1. Started the blog post
2. Worked on Kaggle-Titanic competition pet-project (from now on referd to as KTC)
  - Developed a better understanding of working with the pandas library but still need to research fast ways of manipulating the data within
  

### Current Level
I feel confident with my understanding level C++/C, and Python for basic and intermediate tasks. I would even go as far as to say that although not in an elegant or time efficient manner, I'm confident I can come up with and/or hack a method of solving most basic fundamental algorithms by using my curent skills. I usually lack the determination to finalise or refine most of the pet projects I start, due to a combination of available time and the constant strive to start and learn something new - which gets me well excited. 

I have been using either Linux (different distros including ArchLinux, Fedora, Debian with Ubuntu being my main OS at the moment) or MacOS for years now, and love using the terminal for small projects and/or educational procrastination. As you can hopefully tel from my GitHUB, I have a working understanding of the concept of versioning, and version control (which I am an absolute fan of, and tried bringing into the world of architecture). 

These skills have been gathered over time and a passion for tinkering around. I can't put my finger on when I've learnt any of the above, but rather I consider them to have just occurred over the years.

I am not as confident, but I am passionately curious and interested in AI and ML. At the intersection of Mathematics and CS, I have always wanted to work within this realm (more on this, hopefully will be written in the background section at some point). 

### Aims
Thus:
1. Focus my educational efforts going forward into developing a good understanding of AI/ML and how to apply it
2. Focus my attention on one pet-project rather than try and start new one after new one

#### Why does this matter?
I guess it doesn't matter much, in the real sense for anyone else except myself. I am completely out of my comfort zone writing about this on the internet, as I consider myself quite an intreverted person, and certainly suffer from the "spectator anxiety". I am trying to use that exposure to "uncomfortable" to keep me posting and moving into the direction of achieving the goal. If you are reading this (as you can tell I am also an *optimist*, thinking that someone else would read this) and it motivates you to follow that one path that you always wanted to, then maybe it's not useless after all.
